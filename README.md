# 🪵 The Coralogix Management SDK 

🌟 [Master Docs](https://coralogix.github.io/coralogix-management-sdk) 🌟

## REST and OpenAPI

The Go SDK talks to Coralogix over REST OpenAPI clients in `go/openapi`.
Read more at the [OpenAPI Docs](https://docs.coralogix.com).

The Go gRPC clients were removed. Use `go/openapi/cxsdk` for new work.
The SCIM Users HTTP client remains in the `go` package.

The Rust SDK still uses protobuf in `proto/`.

*These endpoints follow the same versioning schemes mentioned below.*

# Versioning

The SDK follows a rolling release schedule with one LTS version once a year (in June). Revisions allow additional fixes that add hotfixes for immediate bugs, security fixes, etc. The remaining issue fixes are rolled up in the following month’s release. The exception is the LTS release which will contain relevant fixes. 

### LTS

Every year in June the x.6.x version is considered LTS and will be backwards compatible for a year. This is the version recommended for any stable product (Terraform Provider, …) and will be maintained without major (API-related) changes.

### Examples

Here are a few examples of (anticipated) versions:

- 0.12.0 → Year 0 (= 2024), month (12), revision (0)
- 1.1.0 → January 2025 without any additional revisions
- 1.6.10 → June 2025 (LTS) with 10 revisions

# Building

## Prerequisites

- `Make` - for Go development
- `protoc` - only if you contribute to the Rust SDK

The file `proto-toolchain-versions.txt` contains the versions of the protobuf tools that you need for the Rust SDK.

Please refer to the individual languages on how to build the SDKs

## Configuration

The SDK can be configured using environment variables:

- `CORALOGIX_TEAM_API_KEY`: The API key that is used for all team-level interactions. Note that it has to have appropriate permissions. Read the [docs](https://coralogix.com/docs/api-keys/) for more information.
- `CORALOGIX_USER_API_KEY`: The API key that is used for all user-level interactions. Note that it has to have appropriate permissions. Read the [docs](https://coralogix.com/docs/api-keys/) for more information.
- `CORALGOIX_REGION`: The region/cluster to connect to as a shorthand (EU2, AP1, etc. read more [here](https://coralogix.com/docs/coralogix-domain/)). 

Furthermore, if you want to run the examples locally, you're going to to have set the following environment variables:
- `AWS_REGION`: The aws region that you wanna use in the examples, eg. `eu-north-1`.
- `METRICS_BUCKET`: The name of the S3 bucket that you want to use for the archive-metrics example.
- `LOGS_BUCKET`: The name of the S3 bucket that you want to use for the archive-logs example.

Please note that for all examples these variables have to be set to a valid cluster and API key.

# Examples
You'll find some example use-cases of the SDK in the `examples` folder under each programming language. Please, keep in mind that `aaa` stands for "authentication, authorization and accounting", so you should look there if you're looking for an example related to one of those areas.

# Protobuf

The `proto/` directory is the source for the Rust SDK. The Go SDK does not generate gRPC clients from these files.
