# ðŸªµ The Coralogix Management SDK 

ðŸŒŸ [Master Docs](https://coralogix.github.io/coralogix-management-sdk) ðŸŒŸ

## REST and OpenAPI

Our APIs are also avaialable over REST through a variety of OpenAPI endpoints. Read more over at the [OpenAPI Docs](https://docs.coralogix.com)

*These endpoints follow the same versioning schemes mentioned below.*

# Versioning

The SDK follows a rolling release schedule with one LTS version once a year (in June). Revisions allow additional fixes that add hotfixes for immediate bugs, security fixes, etc. The remaining issue fixes are rolled up in the following monthâ€™s release. The exception is the LTS release which will contain relevant fixes. 

### LTS

Every year in June the x.6.x version is considered LTS and will be backwards compatible for a year. This is the version recommended for any stable product (Terraform Provider, â€¦) and will be maintained without major (API-related) changes.

### Examples

Here are a few examples of (anticipated) versions:

- 0.12.0 â†’ Year 0 (= 2024), month (12), revision (0)
- 1.1.0 â†’ January 2025 without any additional revisions
- 1.6.10 â†’ June 2025 (LTS) with 10 revisions

# Building

## Prerequisites

- `protoc` - for compiling protobuf files
- `Make` - for Go development

The file `proto-toolchain-versions.txt` contains the versions of the protobuf tools that you need to contribute to the SDK: please make sure these are the versions that you have on your system.

Please refer to the individual languages on how to build the SDKs

## Configuration

The SDK can be configured using environment variables:

- `CORALOGIX_TEAM_API_KEY`: The API key that is used for all team-level interactions. Note that it has to have appropriate permissions. Read the [docs](https://coralogix.com/docs/api-keys/) for more information.
- `CORALOGIX_USER_API_KEY`: The API key that is used for all user-level interactions. Note that it has to have appropriate permissions. Read the [docs](https://coralogix.com/docs/api-keys/) for more information.
- `CORALGOIX_REGION`: The region/cluster to connect to as a shorthand (EU2, AP1, etc. read more [here](https://coralogix.com/docs/coralogix-domain/)). 

Furthermore, if you want to run the examples locally, you're going to to have set the following environment variables:
- `AWS_REGION`: The aws region that you wanna use in the examples, eg. `eu-north-1`.
- `METRICS_BUCKET`: The name of the S3 bucket that you want to use for the archive-metrics example.
- `LOGS_BUCKET`: The name of the S3 bucket that you want to use for the archive-logs example.

Please note that for all examples these variables have to be set to a valid cluster and API key.

# Examples
You'll find some example use-cases of the SDK in the `examples` folder under each programming language. Please, keep in mind that `aaa` stands for "authentication, authorization and accounting", so you should look there if you're looking for an example related to one of those areas.

# Protobuf

The `proto/` directory contains all protobuf files for generating your own SDK if necessary. They are also the basis for all SDKs in this repository.
